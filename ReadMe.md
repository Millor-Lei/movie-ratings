### Movie Ratings Dashboard

This is a full-stack web application for collecting and visualizing movie rating data. Users can submit movie titles and ratings, which are then processed by a Flask backend and stored in a JSON file. The application features a user-friendly front end with a modal-based rating form and interactive visualizations.


- **Frontend**
  - HTML + CSS (custom styling)
  - JavaScript (vanilla)
  - Modal form and rating validation

- **Backend**
  - Python + Flask
  - JSON API endpoint for data collection
  - Data persistence using `ratings.json`

- **Visualization (Planned)**
  - Chart.js or D3.js for rating distribution histograms
